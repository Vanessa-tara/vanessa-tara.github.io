    "text": "Hi! I’m Vanessa Dator and I’m a senior at Middlebury College, majoring in Psychology and minoring in Education Studies.\nMy passion for enhancing workspaces through creative programming and efficient administration has shaped my active involvement in the Middlebury community over the years. I’ve had the privilege of contributing to impactful organizations like the Senior Committee and the Activities Board, where I strengthened my organizational skills and collaborated with diverse groups on a large scale to enrich the student experience.\nMy commitment to community enhancement extends beyond Middlebury. As a Student Ambassador for College Match, I assist with event planning and logistics to help expose marginalized high school students to higher education opportunities, while also supporting current Middlebury students as they navigate college life. Additionally, this past summer, I served as a Communications Intern at Vermont Afterschool, where I helped empower youth and advocated for third spaces that provide resources for underserved communities. I look forward to continuing to seek opportunities that enhance the workspace and communities around me.\n\n\nMiddlebury College | Los Angeles, CA\nB.A. in Psychology (Major) and Education Studies (Minor) | Sep 2021 - May 2025\n\n\n\nMiddlebury College | Box Office Student Supervisor | Sep 2022 - Present\nMiddlebury College | Activities Executive Board President | May 2023 - May 2024\nCollege Match | Student Ambassador | Jun 2022 - Present\nVermont Afterschool | Communications Intern | Jun 2024 - Aug 2024\n\n\n\n\nRunning\nYoga\nArts and Crafts (painting, coloring, etc)\n\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     GitHub\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n\n\n\n`"
